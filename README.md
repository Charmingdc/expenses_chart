I learnt more about jQuery AJAX method and working with it to load data from different webpages of different extension and also I discovered the [Tippy] library for displaying tooltips that are dynamic to the height of the element you want it to appear on.

### Useful resources

- [jQuery](https://jquery.com) - jQuery AJAX method me helped me to extract the data from the data.json file and display it in my html file.

- [Tippy](https://atomiks.github.io/tippyjs/) - This is an amazing tooltip library, helped me to display the tooltip that shows when the bars are hovered on. It's a great library that allows customization of tooltips and other advance settings.
